You and Ren follow Teddy through a pair of thick, heavy doors. "Welcome to the Barlow Theatre's main stage," says Teddy with no small amount of pride. "Before you is one of the most opulently decorated stages in the region." 

His voice echoing off the theatre's walls, Teddy goes on to describe the space. "About 50 rows of seats in front of you is the stage. This entire room is decorated with polished brass ornaments and candle sconces, and the walls are lined with portraits of great playwrights, from Shakespeare to Aeschylus."

Next to you, you can hear Ren bouncing on her feet. "Ooh! Mr. Crenshaw, tell {player_name} about Sam Barlow!"

    "That she is," says Teddy. "She could practically run this tour herself if she wanted to." -> Sam_Barlow

    "Of a sort," says Teddy.

=== Sam_Barlow ===
Teddy goes on. "Samuel Barlow was the architect who built this theater. A renaissance man, he traveled the world in search of inspiration, then came here to Lilymist to build a theater where his plays could be shown. He was English, hence the reason 'Barlow Theatre' is spelled with the 'E' after the 'R.'" 
-> Questions_About_Sam_Barlow

=== Questions_About_Sam_Barlow ===

*[Were did he travel?]
    "All over the world. He was born in 1898 to a pair of farmers in a small town in England, but, being a restless man, he didn't stay there long. In his twenties he traveled all of Europe, from Wales down to Greece, and even ventured as far as Japan."
    "Imagine how cool that would be," says Ren. "And he was only 21!"
    ->Questions_About_Sam_Barlow
    
*[Why settle down in Lilymist?]
    "After travelling the world over, he decided that he wanted to be an artist. He tried his hand at a number of different trades, eventually becoming a decent architect, but it was the stage that caught his eye the most."
    "Playwriting specifically," Ren adds.
    Teddy smiles. "Why, of course. When he first travelled to America, Broadway was in its heyday, but he dreamed of establishing a chain of big theatres in smaller, rural towns just like the one he'd grown up in back in England."
    "Hmm," Ren interjects. "Some part of him must've missed home. He wanted to travel the world, but he couldn't just give that up."
    "Not a bad theory, Ren," says Teddy.
    ->Questions_About_Sam_Barlow
    
*[Were his plays any good?]
    Teddy chuckles. "Depends on who you ask. His first work, <i>Man Adrift</i>, was a comedy about a sailor who finds himself shipwrecked on an island, where, by sheer coincidence, all of his forgotten schoolfriends, former lovers, and family members have shipwrecked as well. He's forced to reconcile with them as they all wait to be rescued."
    Ren laughs. "It's a bit of a ridiculous premise," she says.
    "Indeed," says Teddy. "A lot of people compare the protagonist's struggle to avoid all these people in his life with Barlow's own conflicted feelings about leaving his home in England behind to travel the world." Teddy clears his throat. "Unfortunately, though, few critics liked <i>Man Adrift</i>, or any of his subsequent plays. After a while, it became difficult for Sam Barlow to find any big-name theater companies that were willing to put on his shows."
    "Yeah." Ren sighs. "I guess his passion didn't really line up with what people wanted to see on Broadway."
    "Right," says Teddy. "So, being the ambitious man he was, he decided to make his own production company to make his plays, and his own theater where he could show them. Hence, the Barlow Theatre!"
        ->Questions_About_Sam_Barlow
    
*[Let's continue on with the tour.]
    "Alright, then," says Teddy. 
    -> Tour_Continues

//Maybe we need something else here?
//Note to self, do a bit of research on what backstage areas of theaters are like, sense-wise.
Teddy walks you and Ren up onto the stage, then to another set of doors. "Welcome backstage!" he says. "This is where all the magic happened, so to speak. Sam Barlow made a point of hiring local actors and stage professionals from Lilymist for his plays. They never made that big of a splash on the national theater scene, but thanks to this theater being here the community in Lilymist developed a love for performance that never really went away in the century that followed. Our local young performance troupe, the Barlow Society, still puts on shows here every couple of months, and folks come from all over the region to see our Shakespeare performances in the spring and summer."
    "Isn't this great, {player_name}?" says Ren. "It's like having a slice of history right in your own backyard!"

When it comes down to it, history is all about stories, and who doesn't love a good story?"
//Consider adding more cool sensory detail here.
//Emphasize that Barlow wanted this to be "little Broadway."
After exploring the backstage area, Teddy takes you on a tour of the rest of the theater. He describes the front of the building to you, then takes you up to the balcony, then around the lounge area and changing rooms that theater-goers would've used back in the 20s. Ren has something to say about each and every little detail that Teddy shows you.
-> Tour_Continues_3

//Pencil in sensory details
Finally, Teddy walks you through the door of a smaller room near the back of the theater.
"And here we have Sam Barlow's office," he says. "We've furnished the room to resemble what it might have been like back in the 1920s."
Ren gasps, clapping her hands together. "Oh, wow!" she says, "It's so authentic! {player_name}, there're a ton of great pieces of Art Deco furntirue in here. This dark wooden desk, that old-fasioned wall clock, this little four-legged writing stool, andâ€”" Ren stops. "Oh my gosh, that's a typewriter! Mr. Crenshaw, you didn't tell me you set this all up!"
Teddy laughs. "Well, I thought I'd surprise you. You've been on this tour enough times. I thought it'd be nice to give you a little something that you hadn't seen yet. Besides, I thought maybe this could give you a bit of inspiration for that novel you're working on."
"Oh," says Ren, a little shyly, "Thanks, Teddy! I mean, I haven't been working on that novel in a while. And besides, it's set in 1800s, not the Roaring Twenties."

*[Wait... it's not a Victorian Romance, is it?]
